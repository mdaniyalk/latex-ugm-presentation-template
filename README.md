## Installation and Usage

1. **Prerequisites:** Make sure you have a LaTeX distribution installed (e.g., TeX Live, MiKTeX) along with a suitable LaTeX editor. Additionally, install the Poppins font on your system. 

2. **Download:** Download the entire contents of this repository. You can do this by clicking the "Code" button on the repository page and selecting "Download ZIP".

3. **Place Files:** Extract the downloaded ZIP file. Inside, you'll find a file named `main.tex`. This is the main file for the template. Place it in a new folder where you want to work on your presentation.

4. **Compile `main.tex`:** Open `main.tex` with your LaTeX editor and compile it to generate your PDF presentation.  Make sure to compile it with LuaLaTeX or XeLaTeX as the Poppins font requires these compilers.

    - If there are errors related to missing packages, use your LaTeX distribution's package manager to install them. 


**Note:** The provided `main.tex` file acts as a demonstration and starting point for your presentations. You can modify the content within this file to build your own presentation.
